<p>Due to a major fire in our locality, our offices and all our services are currently closed. We are working hard to try to restore things as soon as possible. We have been powered via a generator since Tuesday 7<sup>th</sup> April and UK Power is currently swapping us back to the National Grid. Unfortunately this requires us to shut down all of our services including our much over-stressed UPS system as they require considerably longer than we would normally expect to do this work and brown-outs are highly likely. We expect to be fully up and running on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Should you need to contact us, we do have email working so please try that. Alternatively you can reach us via Twitter @quru or call us on our mobile numbers.</p>
<p>Apologies for any inconvenience.</p>
<p>Enjoy your evening!</p>

To put it into perspective - the London Fire Brigade are still on-site, there is still smoke coming out of the road and the BBC still have cameras there.</p>
