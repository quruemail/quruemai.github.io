<p>Due to a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32157618">major fire</a> in our locality, our offices and all our services are currently closed. We are working hard to try to restore things as soon as possible. To put it into perspective - the London Fire Brigade are still on-site, there is still smoke coming out of the road and the BBC still have cameras there.</p>
<p>Should you need to contact us, we do have email working so please try that. Alternatively you can reach us via Twitter @quru or call +44 20 7160 9729</p>
<p>Apologies for any inconvenience.</p>
<p>Enjoy your Easter week-end!</p>
