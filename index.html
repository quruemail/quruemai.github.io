    <p>Due to a major fire in our locality, our offices and all our services are currently down. We are working hard to try to restore things as soon as possible. To put it into perspecitve, the London Fire Brigade are still on-site, there is still coming out of the smoke and the BBC still have cameras there.</p>
    <p>Should you need to contact us, we do have email working so please try that. Alternatively you can reach us via Twitter @quru</p>
    <p>Apologies for any inconvenience.</p>
